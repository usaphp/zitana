Some of our support channels are better than others for certain types of requests - for example, it is easier to troubleshoot network connectivity over chat rather than by phone because you can paste in your traceroutes and other diagnostics.  We want you to use the support channel that works best for you, so let's look at all the resources we can use to help you, and how best to use them.
          %h3 Navigating to the Support Channels
          %ol

            %li Something else to explain to user
            %li One more step that is required to open a hosting account
            %li This is how you install PHP and other scripts on your Centos server
          %p Next we'll going to show you all the ways that we can provide you with Fanatical Support! Some of our support channels are better than others for certain types of requests - for example, it is easier to troubleshoot network connectivity over chat rather than by phone because you can paste in your traceroutes and other diagnostics.
